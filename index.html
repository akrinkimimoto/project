      <li>You might've heard about this anime fact before. It (normally) costs around $100,000 to $200,000 to make a single anime episode! Then think about how much it'll actually cost to make an entire season!! </li>
      <li>The anime series Noragami featured a stray God who does odd jobs for survival. He used to leave his number everywhere so he could get customers, and guess what, they actually <br>made it so you can call that number irl and talk to Yato!
